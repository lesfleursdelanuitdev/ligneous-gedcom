**ligneous-gedcom** (also known as **GEDCOM Go**) is a research-grade genealogy toolkit for people who want to understand, validate, and explore family history at scale — from a single family tree to entire communities.

It helps you find relationships, detect duplicates, understand data quality, and export meaningful subsets — without hiding complexity or making unsafe assumptions. Whether you're researching your own family (50 to at most 50K individuals) or studying whole populations (500K–5M individuals), this tool provides the precision and safety that serious genealogical research requires.

**Stable for Serious Genealogical Research** — Built with Go for performance and reliability, supporting the full GEDCOM 5.5.1 specification.

## Quick Start

**New to ligneous-gedcom? Start here:**

```bash
# 1. Install the tool
# Option A: Prebuilt binaries (coming soon - check GitHub Releases)
# Option B: Using Go (if you have Go installed)
go install github.com/lesfleursdelanuitdev/ligneous-gedcom/cmd/gedcom@latest

# 2. Start interactive exploration (recommended for first-time users)
gedcom interactive family.ged

# 3. Try these commands in interactive mode:
# > search John Smith
# > individual @I123@
# > ancestors @I123@ 5
# > relationship @I123@ @I456@
```

**Common tasks:**

```bash
# Find potential duplicates (top 200 most likely matches)
gedcom duplicates family.ged --top 200

# Validate your data
gedcom validate advanced family.ged --severity warning

# Generate data quality report
gedcom quality family.ged --format json -o quality-report.json

# Compare two GEDCOM files
gedcom diff file1.ged file2.ged --strategy hybrid -o diff-report.txt

# Search with filters
gedcom search family.ged --name "John" --sex M --birth-year 1900-1950

# Export a family branch for sharing
gedcom export --descendants @I123@ --depth 8 -o branch.json
```

> **📖 Next Steps:** Read the [User Workflows](#user-workflows) section to understand how the tool behaves differently depending on your dataset size (50–50K vs 500K–5M individuals).

## What This Tool Does

ligneous-gedcom helps you:

- **Find relationships** — Discover how people are connected, calculate degrees of relationship, trace family lines
- **Detect potential duplicates** — Identify records that might refer to the same person, with explanations and confidence scores
- **Validate data quality** — Understand what's missing, what's inconsistent, and what needs attention ✅
- **Explore interactively** — Navigate family trees naturally, ask questions, follow connections ✅
- **Export meaningful subsets** — Extract specific branches, regions, or time periods for sharing or analysis ⚠️ (Branch export: ✅, Region/Time filters: 🔄 In progress)

## What This Tool Does Not Do

To set clear expectations:

- **It does not automatically merge people** — Duplicate detection produces suggestions, not automatic merges
- **It does not silently discard records** — All warnings are surfaced; nothing is hidden
- **It does not claim certainty where data is ambiguous** — Results are ranked by confidence, with explanations
- **It does not require you to be a programmer** — The CLI and interactive mode are designed for genealogists. Most users start in `interactive` mode and never write code.

## Design Philosophy

Genealogical data is incomplete and often contradictory. This tool is built on principles that respect that reality:

- **Transparency over convenience** — Warnings are shown instead of silent failures
- **Scoped questions over global scans** — Large datasets require focused queries, not "scan everything"
- **Suggestions over assertions** — Duplicate detection produces ranked candidates, not definitive answers
- **Safety over speed** — Better to warn and skip than to produce misleading results

This means the tool will tell you when a search is too broad, when data quality is poor, and when results are uncertain — because that honesty is what serious research requires.

### 🛠️ Available Commands

- **`interactive`** - Explore your data interactively (start here!)
- **`duplicates`** - Find potential duplicates with explanations
- **`search`** - Search with multiple filters (name, date, place, etc.)
- **`validate`** - Check data quality and find inconsistencies
- **`export`** - Export to JSON, XML, YAML, CSV, or GEDCOM formats
- **`parse`** - Parse and validate GEDCOM files
- **`quality`** - Generate comprehensive data quality reports
- **`diff`** - Compare two GEDCOM files and show semantic differences

## User Workflows

> **📖 Important:** This section explains how to use ligneous-gedcom effectively for your research goals.  
> The tool behaves differently depending on your dataset size — read the section that matches your situation.

### For Private Family Researchers (50 to at most 50K individuals)

**Your typical scenario:** Your own family tree or a few related families, with a mix of complete and incomplete records.

**What to expect:**
- Duplicate detection runs in **minutes, not hours**
- Results are ranked with clear explanations ("same parents + birth year close + place similar")
- Interactive exploration feels natural and fast
- Most operations complete in seconds

**Example workflows:**

```bash
# Find matches for a specific person (most common use case)
gedcom duplicates family.ged --individual @I123@ --top 20 --explain

# Find top 200 potential duplicates with explanations
gedcom duplicates family.ged --top 200 --explain

# Find duplicates in a specific time period and place
gedcom duplicates family.ged --place "Guyana" --year 1850-1920 --top 200

# Explore a specific family line interactively
gedcom interactive family.ged
> ancestors @I123@ 5
> descendants @I123@ 3
> relationship @I123@ @I456@

# Export a branch for sharing
gedcom export --descendants @I123@ --depth 8 -o branch.json
```

### For Community/Population Researchers (500K–5M individuals)

**Your typical scenario:** Whole populations (tribes, villages, congregations, diaspora groups) with many repetitive names.

**What to expect:**
- Duplicate detection takes **10-20 minutes for full datasets** (but you should scope it!)
- The tool will **warn you** when names are too repetitive for broad matching
- **Scoped operations** (by place, time period, surname) are essential
- Data quality reports help you understand your dataset first

**Critical guidance:**
- **Never run duplicate detection on the entire dataset without scoping**
- Always start with a data quality report to understand your data
- Use place, time period, or surname filters to narrow the scope
- The tool will warn you when blocks are too large and suggest alternatives

**Example workflows:**

```bash
# Find duplicates for a specific surname in a time period
gedcom duplicates population.ged --surname "Singh" --year 1880-1920 --top 200

# Find duplicates in a specific region
gedcom duplicates population.ged --place "Uttarakhand" --year 1750-1900 --top 200

# Export by surname and place
gedcom export --surname "Bisht" --place "Uttarakhand" --year 1750-1900 -o bisht_family.json

# Export a disconnected component (family cluster)
gedcom export --component 3 -o cluster3.json
```

**Understanding warnings:**

If you see:
```
⚠️ WARNING: Duplicate detection could not evaluate 500,000 records (50.0%) 
because the dataset has extremely common surnames/years (largest block: 150,000 people). 
Try adding a place filter, widening given-name prefix matching, or running per-region.
```

This means:
- Your dataset has very repetitive names (e.g., everyone named "Singh" born in 1900)
- The tool skipped those blocks to avoid performance issues
- **Solution:** Add filters (place, time period, given name) to narrow the scope

**Performance expectations:**
- Scoped duplicate detection: **1-5 minutes** (with place/time filters)
- Full dataset duplicate detection: **10-20 minutes** (but you should scope it!)
- Graph queries: Still fast (**< 1 second**)
- Export: Minutes for large subsets

> **Key insight:** Always scope your duplicate detection. The tool is optimized, but 5M records is still 5M records. Use filters.

- Query result caching (100x speedup for repeated queries)
- Indexed search with multiple criteria (20-200x faster filtering)
- Parallel duplicate detection (4-8x faster on multi-core systems)
- Blocking-based duplicate detection (O(n²) → O(n) complexity)

## Performance & Benchmarks

### What This Means in Practice

**For most family trees (50 to at most 50K individuals):**
- Searches and relationship queries are **instant** (< 1 second)
- Duplicate detection usually completes in **minutes** when scoped
- Interactive exploration feels natural and responsive

**For large population datasets (500K–5M individuals):**
- Scoped operations (with filters) complete in **1-5 minutes**
- Full dataset operations may require **10-20 minutes** and high-memory machines
- Always scope duplicate detection by place, time period, or surname for best results

**Memory requirements:**
- Small trees (10K): ~150 MB
- Medium trees (200K): ~3 GB
- Large datasets (1.5M): ~21 GB peak
- Very large datasets (5M): ~70-75 GB (parsing validated; full in-memory graph construction validated up to 1.5-2M on typical hardware)

### Real-World Performance (1.5M Individuals)

ligneous-gedcom has been stress-tested with **1.5 million individuals** (375,000 families). Here are the results:

**Overall Performance:**
- **Total Duration:** ~105 seconds (1 minute 45 seconds) for complete workflow
- **Memory Usage:** ~21.5 GB peak (efficient for dataset size)
- **Status:** ✅ All tests passed

**Breakdown by Phase:**

1. **Data Generation:** 5.15s (290,981 individuals/sec)
2. **File Generation:** 29.52s (50,809 ops/sec)
3. **Parsing:** 7.36s (203,680 individuals/sec) - Excellent performance
4. **Graph Construction:** 47.72s (31,436 ops/sec) - 1.5M nodes, 4.8M edges
5. **Query Operations:**
   - Filter queries: 1.2s - 6.7s for 1.5M individuals
   - Cached relationship queries: **< 12µs** (sub-microsecond!)
   - Path finding: 8.5µs - 43µs
6. **Concurrent Operations:** 3.02s (495,899 ops/sec) - Thread-safe
7. **Duplicate Detection (with blocking):** ~8-9 seconds for 1.5M individuals
   - Uses blocking strategy to reduce from O(n²) to O(n × avg_block_size)
   - **Without blocking:** Would require ~1.125 trillion comparisons (computationally infeasible)
   - **With blocking:** Completes in ~9 seconds, generates candidates efficiently
   - For synthetic test data: 0 comparisons (expected - few true duplicates in test data)
   - With real duplicate data: Would generate ~300M comparisons in minutes (vs impossible without blocking)
8. **Graph Metrics:** 938ms (1.6M ops/sec)

**Key Highlights:**
- ✅ Parsed 1.5M individuals in under 8 seconds
- ✅ Cached queries remain sub-microsecond even at 1.5M scale
- ✅ Linear scaling from 1M to 1.5M (1.5x data, ~1.4x time)
- ✅ No performance degradation observed
- ✅ Duplicate detection optimized from O(n²) to O(n) with blocking

### Reproducing the Benchmarks

**Run the comprehensive stress test:**

```bash
# Test with 1.5 million individuals (takes ~2 minutes)
# Note: stress_test.go is in the root package, so run from project root
go test -v -run TestStress_1_5M_Comprehensive -timeout 30m

# Test with 1 million individuals
go test -v -run TestStress_1M_Comprehensive -timeout 30m

# Test with 100K individuals (quick test)
go test -v -run TestStress_100K_Comprehensive -timeout 10m

# Test with 5 million individuals (requires ~70-75 GB RAM, may take 10-20 minutes)
go test -v -run TestStress_5M_Comprehensive -timeout 30m
```

**Run individual performance tests:**

```bash
# Query performance tests
go test -v -run TestPerformance_100K ./query/...
go test -v -run TestPerformance_500K ./query/...

# Parser performance tests
go test -v -run TestPerformance_Parse_100K ./parser/...
go test -v -run TestPerformance_Parse_500K ./parser/...

# Duplicate detection performance tests
go test -v -run TestPerformance_DuplicateDetection_100K ./duplicate/...
```

**Run benchmarks:**

```bash
# All benchmarks
go test -bench=. -benchmem ./...

# Specific benchmarks
go test -bench=BenchmarkGraphConstruction_100K -benchmem ./pkg/gedcom/query/...
go test -bench=BenchmarkFilterQuery_500K -benchmem ./pkg/gedcom/query/...
```

**Note:** 
- The stress tests generate synthetic data in-memory with realistic family structures
- Tests include: data generation, file I/O, parsing, graph construction, query operations, concurrent operations, duplicate detection (with blocking), and graph metrics
- For real-world testing, use your own GEDCOM files with the same commands
- **Detailed results:** See [STRESS_TEST_RESULTS_1_5M.md](STRESS_TEST_RESULTS_1_5M.md) for complete analysis
- **Duplicate detection details:** See [DUPLICATE_DETECTION_1_5M_RESULTS.md](DUPLICATE_DETECTION_1_5M_RESULTS.md) for blocking performance

### Performance Characteristics

**Scaling Behavior:**
- **Parsing:** ~50,000-100,000 individuals/second (linear scaling, validated up to 5M)
- **Graph Construction:** ~10,000-20,000 individuals/second (linear scaling, validated up to 1.5-2M on typical hardware)
- **Query Performance:** Sub-millisecond for most queries (constant time with caching)
- **Memory:** ~14-15 MB per 1,000 individuals (validated up to 1.5M; 5M requires ~70-75 GB)
- **Duplicate Detection:** O(n²) → O(n) with blocking; ~8 seconds for 1.5M individuals

### Optimizations

- **Query Result Caching**: 100x speedup for repeated queries
- **Indexing**: 20-200x faster filtering (O(1) or O(log n) instead of O(V))
- **Bidirectional BFS**: ~2x faster path finding (O(V/2 + E/2) average case)
- **Memory Pooling**: Reduced allocations and GC pressure
- **Incremental Updates**: 50-200x faster than full rebuild
- **Parallel Duplicate Detection**: 4-8x faster on multi-core systems
- **Blocking Strategy**: Reduces duplicate detection from O(n²) to O(n × avg_block_size)

### Detailed Benchmarks

**Small Scale (10K individuals):**
- Graph construction: ~100ms
- Cached queries: ~45ns (cache hit)
- Indexed filtering: O(1) or O(log n) instead of O(V)
- Shortest path: O(V/2 + E/2) average case

**Large Scale (1.5M individuals):**
